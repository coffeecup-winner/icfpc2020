 \page  migration_1_4   Migrating Code from FLTK 1.3 to 1.4

This appendix describes the differences between the FLTK
1.3.x and FLTK 1.4.x functions and classes.

\section migration_1_4_old_versions Migrating from FLTK 1.0 or 1.1 to 1.4

If you want to migrate your code from FLTK 1.0 or 1.1 to FLTK 1.4,
then you should first consult the relevant appendices in FLTK 1.3
documentation online or by downloading the FLTK 1.3 documentation.
See https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/index.html
and/or https://www.fltk.org/software.php , respectively.


\section migration_1_4_headers Minor Changes in Header Files

(to be documented)



\section migration_1_4_preferences Fl_Preferences

Starting with FLTK 1.3, preference databases are expected to be in UTF-8
encoding. Previous databases were stored in the current character set or
code page which renders them incompatible for text entries using
international characters.

Starting with FLTK 1.4, searching a valid path to store the preferences
files has changed slightly. Please see
Fl_Preferences::Fl_Preferences(Root, const char*, const char*)
for details.

If you want to retain user preferences you may want to move the preferences
file from its old location to the new location as documented in
Fl_Preferences::Fl_Preferences(Root, const char*, const char*) .
